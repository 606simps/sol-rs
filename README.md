# Solaris

Solidity Smart Contracts test harness written in Rust using the native Parity Client EVM.

## Benefits

+ Statically typed tests in Rust: if the contract changes the test code does not compile
+ Using native Parity EVM: latest stuff from Parity - will run exactly the same as on chain
+ High performance: no servers, directly to EVM, etc...
